  - Main challenge is the shift in domain of data from training to inference ‚≠êÔ∏è
  - Train a classfier to work well on clean audio --> Fine tune it to work well on noisy audio ‚≠êÔ∏è
  - **Be aware that not all species mentioned in the secondary label column might be part of the training data.** 
  - For training, you can focus on primary and secondary labels. ‚≠êÔ∏è
  - For a **submission**, you should use the **ebird code**.  ‚≠êÔ∏è
  - You should definitely consider using secondary labels to validate your multi-class classifier, *but (again) be aware that these labels are only weak labels with no timestamp*. üî™
  - "**secondary_labels will be better than background**. But both are almost same and week labels regarding label quality"
